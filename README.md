# Virtual-City
Prototype 3D City Game
- After donwload install the following assets (from the Unity Asset Store) using Package Manager:
    -   Sleek essential UI pack by F3jry (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/icons/sleek-essential-ui-pack-170650)
    - SimplePoly City - Low Poly Assets by VenCreations (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/simplepoly-city-low-poly-assets-58899)
        - If any issues arise regarding materials select them and go to Window > Rendering > Render Pipeline Converter, and tick Material Upgrade, then press "Initialize And Convert".
- Other external assets used:
    - [non copyright music] Lofi Type Beat - imperfect | aesthetic lofi music / Lofiru on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTQAjKBNp8g)

- The Prototype Functionalities
    - 3D 30x30 City
        -  Can be moved around (left mouse button) and tiled (left mouse button)
        - Originally all assets were created manually using Unity ProBuilder to test all features
        - Later changed to use external assets to be more visually appealing
        - Playable version also available on itch.io at (LINK_NOT_YET_EXISTS)
    - Deployable assets by clicking on their UI button and dragging to desired spawn location
        - If they are outside the city or in contact with already existing scene items they won't appear
        - If they can spawn, the trees near them are destroyed
        - Each spawned object has a particle effect
    -  2 Ranomized Events
        - These events are triggered by a UI button for testing
        - Events spawn physics-based objects which prevent new deployable assets placements
        - Can be removed by moving or tilting the city
        - One event spawns 1 hazard near each existing city item (including spawned ones)
        - The other spawns a multitude of small hazards on the city location
        - Each have unique particle effects
    - UI made to be intuitive and appealing
        - Zooming in UI buttons when hovered on and the icon fade outs when trying to place an deployable asset are good examples.
    - Other Features:
        - Sounds
            - Simple sound effects were implemented for some game actions
        - Skybox & Background
            - Changed the preset skybox with a new one and added transparent spheres in the far background to appear as halos (my take on the halo-like effect seen in the example)
        - Simple car driving around 4 set points on the road for aesthetics
        - Simple actual game structure (place as many buildings in the city within 30 seconds, while events happen every 6 to see what's the highest you can get)
    - Future Iteration Possibilities:
        - Better game structure (e.g. place as many buildings in the city without destroying trees within a set ammount of time, while events happen frequently and need to be dealt with made modularly so there could be levels, more requirements, etc)
        - Color change of City while being held
        - Camera Shake on City Grab (not relevant for XR)
        - Working traffic system
        - Civilian NPCs (with set movement/random movement, based on NavMeshes for example)
     
- Unity Scene Descriptions
    - The Sample Scene (where I created and tested most of the features before changing the assets & has already changed UI).
    - The Scene With New Assets which has all the requested features plus the car driving around four map points.
    - The Gameplay Scene which has everything previously created with simple game logic. This is the version available on itch.io (LINK_NOT_YET_AVAILABLE).
